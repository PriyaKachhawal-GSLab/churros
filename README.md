API testing framework to test the Cloud Elements APIs

## setup
If you don't have `node` and `npm` installed, do that first.

```bash
$ npm install
```

## running
After you have things setup, just run `npm test` to run all of the tests.  The `cli` is still being worked on, which will provide a much more granular approach so you can run a single suite and/or a single test at once.

```bash
$ npm test
```
